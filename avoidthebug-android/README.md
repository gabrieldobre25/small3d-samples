If you receive an error that looks like this when opening the project in Android Studio:

No version of NDK matched the requested version (A). Versions available locally: (B)

... you need to set your NDK version to the one you have installed (B). So you need to open the
project structure dialog by clicking on the project structure icon ![project structure icon](projectstructureandroid.png)
or by pressing Ctr+Alt+Shift+S and then setting the "NDK version" under "Modules" to (B).
